# Ethereum ERC20 SPC

This smart contract was done using truffule and zepplin-solidity.

The directory `compiled` contains a flattened version of the contract and solidity prepared abi and bin files although the actual contract was deployed and compiled with truffle.

```
npm install -g truffle
npm install zeppelin-solidity
truffle compile
truffle migrate --verbose-rpc --network live
```
